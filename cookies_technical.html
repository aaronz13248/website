<h2 id="title">Remember that cookies contain no executable code. They aren't inherently evil.</h2>
<h1 id="title2" class="hidden">Now that wasn't so bad, was it?</h1>
<p>In the simplest terms, a cookie is a name and a value. For instance, the cookie that you (could) get from this site has the name "EATEN_COOKIE" and can have a value of 'true' or 'false'.
Most cookies are harmless. They store a bit of information, in this case, that you clicked the button, and send that information back to the site it came from the next time you visit it.</p>
<p>For example, this line of text wouldn't be visible if you hadn't clicked the button. Try it! Load this page on another browser, and see for yourself.</p>
<p>The purpose of a cookie varies, since they can be used to do many things. Remembering what a user did in a previous visit can have many purposeful uses.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Whether or not a user did something (i.e. click a button to eat a cookie)</li>
    <li>The user's IP address/device ID to remember a friendly device (ahem, Google 2SA/2FA)</li>
    <li>The user's status on if they recently donated to the news site</li>
    <li>A whole variety of personalization settings (i.e. night mode)</li>
    <li>and who could forget: targeting ads based on previous user activity</li>
</ul>
<h2>There are two big categories of cookies: First-party and Third-party.</h2>
<p>As you might expect, first-party cookies come directly from the website you are visiting, and are the typically 
    innocuous ones that deal with authentication, site preferences, and other essential functions. The cookie that 
    you would have eaten if you gotten here via the button on the home page is a first party cookie, since I created 
    it and told your browser to store it. No other website can access it unless I give them my Javascript code.
</p>
<p>Third-party cookies, on the other hand, are the kind that could 'follow' you across multiple websites since they
    don't originate from the website that you are visiting. They are created by a third party, hence the name, and 
    are typically used by multiple websites for functions that benefit from using data that is about your internet 
    activity more generally instead of your activity on any specific site (i.e. targeting ads).
