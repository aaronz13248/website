    <h1 id="title2" class="hidden">Now that wasn't so bad, was it?</h1>

    <p class="caption">Cookies from this website. The first two are provided by github.</p>
    <p>In simplest terms, a cookie is a name and a value. You can find them in the 'application' tab if you inspect element.</p>
    <div id="funtext" class="hidden">
    <p>For instance, the cookie that you (could) get from this site has the name "ateCookie" and has a value of 'true'.
    Most cookies are harmless. They store a bit of information, in this case, that you clicked the button, and send that information back to the site it came from the next time you visit it.</p>
    <p>For example, this line of text wouldn't be visible if you hadn't clicked that button. The button below will remove the cookie. After clicking it, refresh the page and see this text go missing.</p>
    <button onclick="vomitCookie()">Click Me</button>
    </div>
    <p>The purpose of a cookie varies, since they can be used to do many things. Remembering what a user did in a previous visit can have many purposeful uses.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Whether or not a user did something (i.e. donated to wikipedia)</li>
        <li>The user's IP address/device ID to remember a friendly device (ahem, Google 2SA/2FA)</li>
        <li>Remembering if the user clicked a "Do not show me this again" button</li>
        <li>A whole variety of personalization settings (i.e. night mode)</li>
        <li>and who could forget: targeting ads based on previous user activity</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Of course, the best way to know what a website uses cookies for is to read its cookie policy. Google, which is by some estimates the biggest third-party cookie provider, <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/cookies?hl=en-US">has its own rules of how their cookies can be used.</a></p>
    <h2>Wait, third-party cookies? What are those?</h2>
    <p>Cookies can come from any part of a website, including embeds that come from other sites. GoogleAdServices/DoubleClick is a very popular product that websites use to personalize ads.</p>
    <p>Cookies that come directly from the website you are visiting are called <b>first-party cookies</b>, and are the typically 
        innocuous ones that deal with authentication, site preferences, and other essential functions. The "ateCookie" cookie that 
        you would have received if you got here via the button on the home page is a first party cookie, since I created 
        it and told your browser to store it. Other websites can't (legally) use my cookie without my permission.
    </p>
    <p><b>Third-party cookies</b>, on the other hand, are the kind that could 'follow' you across multiple websites since they
        don't originate from the website that you are visiting. They are created by a third party, hence the name, and 
        are typically used for functions that benefit from using data that tracks all internet 
        activity more generally instead of your activity on any specific site (i.e. recommending products or ads). 
        They can be accessed by any website that uses ads from their creators. 
    </p>
    <h2>So what's the big deal? Doesn't Google know everything anyway?</h2>
    <p>This sentiment just emphasizes how engrained cookies are in internet usage. Without cookies, it is not possible for GoogleAdServices or any other data collection service to know as much as they do about your internet activity.</p>
    <p>This kind of cookie is more sophisticated than a simple "ateCookie=true" line. Sure, everyone knows about Google being able to remember what ads you click on, but they also know which ads you moused over, and which you ignored entirely. Using this information, they can build a profile of what you may or may not be interested in and effective ways to market to you. This information can then be sold to whomever can pay for it.</p>
    <p>Remember that the GDPR laws only apply inside the EU, and that is is merely suggested that websites elsewhere ask you for your consent to cookies. So that means you could be browsing a site, and be tagged with all your ad interaction history without your knowledge.</p>
