    <p class="caption">Cookies from this website. The first two are provided by github.</p>
    <p>In simplest terms, a cookie is a name and a value. You can find them in the 'application' tab if you inspect element.</p>
    <div id="funtext" class="hidden">
    <p>For instance, the cookie that you (could) get from this site has the name "ateCookie" and has a value of 'true'.
    Most cookies are harmless. They store a bit of information, in this case, that you clicked the button, and send that information back to the site it came from the next time you visit it.</p>
    <p>For example, this line of text wouldn't be visible if you hadn't clicked that button. The button below will remove the cookie. After clicking it, refresh the page and see this text go missing.</p>
    <button onclick="vomitCookie()">Click Me</button>
    </div>
    <p>The purpose of a cookie varies, since they can be used to do many things. Remembering what a user did in a previous visit can have many purposeful uses.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Whether or not a user did something (i.e. donated to wikipedia)</li>
        <li>The user's IP address/device ID to remember a friendly device (ahem, Google 2SA/2FA)</li>
        <li>Remembering if the user clicked a "Do not show me this again" button</li>
        <li>A whole variety of personalization settings (i.e. night mode)</li>
        <li>and who could forget: targeting ads based on previous user activity</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>There are two big categories of cookies: First-party and Third-party.</h2>
    <p>As you might expect, first-party cookies come directly from the website you are visiting, and are the typically 
        innocuous ones that deal with authentication, site preferences, and other essential functions. The cookie that 
        you would have received if you got here via the button on the home page is a first party cookie, since I created 
        it and told your browser to store it. Other websites can't (legally) use my cookie without my permission.
    </p>
    <p>Third-party cookies, on the other hand, are the kind that could 'follow' you across multiple websites since they
        don't originate from the website that you are visiting. They are created by a third party, hence the name, and 
        are typically used by multiple websites for functions that benefit from using data that tracks all internet 
        activity more generally instead of your activity on any specific site (i.e. recommending products or ads).
