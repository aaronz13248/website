        <h1 class="bigTitle">Protecting Your Cookies Against Malice</h1>
        <h1>Wait, what? How does it get worse than ads scraping your cookies for targeting information?</h1>
        <h2>Glad you asked.</h2>
        <p>Remember that cookies are just text stored in your browser, and that websites read those cookies to make decisions.</p>
        <p>For example, an autofill cookie contains a unique ID stored on your computer that matches with a hash on the website that will autofill your login information in the appropriate fields.</p>
        <p>If a criminal were to intercept or read that cookie, they could set a cookie with the same name and value as your cookie, and gain access to your account without having to guess your username or password.</p>
        <p>Because your cookies contain information about almost all your internet activity, a breach to your cookie security can have far-reaching consequences.</p>
        <h2>Cookies, because of their simplicity, can represent the weakest link in your personal privacy.</h2>
        <h1>So, what can you do about it? Is disabling all cookies an option?</h1>
        <p>It is certainly possible to block all cookies from your device with cybersecurity applications or browser extensions, but this nuclear option is not recommended.</p>
        <p>Remember that websites need some cookies to perform basic functions, and without them, some sites may not work.</p>
